# Steel-Defect-Detection-Pytorch
A deep learning project using pytorch

## Objective
1. To practise using git
2. To practise using pytorch
3. Use .py instead of .ipynb to build a project
4. Realise an new idea of model architecture

## New idea of model architecture
2 steps (Combine 2 models tgt):  
1. To predict defect classes (multi-label classification)
2. To predict the defect mask (using step1 model as input)
